2011-03-05  13:55:46     ME:    I'm able to look past it. ;-) But I am curious... other than the things
                                you like to do (yoga, tan, making out, etc.), what makes you interesting?
2011-03-05  13:56:35    HER:    I like to read too. 
2011-03-05  14:00:15     ME:    That's good, and i don't have any expectations of you, but i guess i
                                mean your qualities as a person (loyalty, spontaneity, generosity).
                                I'm just curious.
2011-03-05  14:01:44    HER:    I'm a very generous person usually. Lol. I'm super loyal like a dog
                                usually. Lol. I'm sweet, caring, fun, silly, me. Lol. Idk know what else.
2011-03-05  15:47:09     ME:    Think. LOL. ;-). This is some serious introspection-I'm-a-confident-
                                ambitious-secure woman stuff right here. You should have this written
                                down somewhere. ;-)
2011-03-05  15:47:37     ME:    Come up with two more and you get a reward.
2011-03-05  15:49:11    HER:    Goal oriented, social, organized.   
2011-03-05  15:54:49     ME:    Haha. Okay. You win. You think pretty highly of yourself, don't you? :-)
2011-03-05  15:55:30    HER:    Yes. Usually. Honestly sure. Lol. 
2011-03-05  15:57:40     ME:    Awe. :-) that's my girl. You're cute. But i'm never going to forget you
                                "spraying" me with words the other night.

2011-03-08  08:04:22     ME:    Hey cricket. Lol. You can't txt me non-stop all day like that. I ran
                                out of fuel. :-( A repercussion of having been so long since seeing
                                your smile in person.
2011-03-08  08:05:21     ME:    Ps. We should fix that.
2011-03-08  08:05:53    HER:    Cricket!?!? What? Lol. 
2011-03-08  10:12:42     ME:    Yes, Cricket. STOP TEXTING ME, stalker! [ P.S. This is so random: I
                                had the DIRTIEST dream of you last night. ]
2011-03-08  10:13:15    HER:    What was it about?

2011-03-08  13:20:50    HER:    And...
2011-03-09  00:01:13     ME:    ...long black hair draped down your arm as you looked back at me over
                                your shoulder. Our eyes meet. Breathing heavily, persperation powdered
                                your cheeks...
2011-03-09  00:20:19    HER:    ...
2011-03-09  00:28:35     ME:    Ditch the boys you toy with and come meet me on the dark side. This week.
                                One night. Benign adventure. If it suits you, I'll tell you all the rest
                                and more.
2011-03-09  00:45:22    HER:    Ask me tomorrow.
2011-03-09  00:50:08     ME:    I don't chase
2011-03-09  00:52:18    HER:    I don't either. Lol.
2011-03-09  00:53:09    HER:    I'm side tracked right now that's why I said ask me tomorrow.
2011-03-09  01:06:58     ME:    Tomorrow is a busy day. We'll see. :-) Good night, lil' bite.
2011-03-09  01:11:43    HER:    Night
